    Parameters
    ----------
    df: dask.DataFrame
        Data to save
    url_path: str, list of str
        Location to write to. If a string, and there are more than one
        partitions in df, should include a glob character to expand into a
        set of file names, or provide a ``name_function=`` parameter.
        Supports protocol specifications such as ``"s3://"``.
    encoding, errors:
        The text encoding to implement, e.g., "utf-8" and how to respond
        to errors in the conversion (see ``str.encode()``).
    orient, lines, kwargs
        passed to pandas; if not specified, lines=True when orient='records',
        False otherwise.
    storage_options: dict
        Passed to backend file-system implementation
    compute: bool
        If true, immediately executes. If False, returns a set of delayed
        objects, which can be computed at a later time.
    compute_kwargs : dict, optional
        Options to be passed in to the compute method
    encoding, errors:
        Text conversion, ``see str.encode()``
    compression : string or None
        String like 'gzip' or 'xz'.
    name_function : callable, default None
        Function accepting an integer (partition index) and producing a
        string to replace the asterisk in the given filename globstring.
        Should preserve the lexicographic order of partitions.

    """Create a dataframe from a set of JSON files

    This utilises ``pandas.read_json()``, and most parameters are
    passed through - see its docstring.

    Differences: orient is 'records' by default, with lines=True; this
    is appropriate for line-delimited "JSON-lines" data, the kind of JSON output
    that is most common in big-data scenarios, and which can be chunked when
    reading (see ``read_json()``). All other options require blocksize=None,
    i.e., one partition per input file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    url_path: str, list of str
        Location to read from. If a string, can include a glob character to
        find a set of file names.
        Supports protocol specifications such as ``"s3://"``.
    encoding, errors:
        The text encoding to implement, e.g., "utf-8" and how to respond
        to errors in the conversion (see ``str.encode()``).
    orient, lines, kwargs
        passed to pandas; if not specified, lines=True when orient='records',
        False otherwise.
    storage_options: dict
        Passed to backend file-system implementation
    blocksize: None or int
        If None, files are not blocked, and you get one partition per input
        file. If int, which can only be used for line-delimited JSON files,
        each partition will be approximately this size in bytes, to the nearest
        newline character.
    sample: int
        Number of bytes to pre-load, to provide an empty dataframe structure
        to any blocks without data. Only relevant is using blocksize.
    encoding, errors:
        Text conversion, ``see bytes.decode()``
    compression : string or None
        String like 'gzip' or 'xz'.
    engine : function object, default ``pd.read_json``
        The underlying function that dask will use to read JSON files. By
        default, this will be the pandas JSON reader (``pd.read_json``).
