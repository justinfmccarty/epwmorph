"""Constellation identification.

Constellation identification is tradionally performed with:

Given a position, a binary search can be used to index into its roughly
12k data table for a matching declination, but the table then needs to
be scanned linearly for the first subsequent segment that contains the
target right ascension within its bounds.  The big problem for Skyfield:
that algorithm can't be constructed from vectorized NumPy primitives.

So we here take an approach that requires no linear search.  The sky is
divided into a grid, with a grid line at every right ascension and
declination that is mentioned in a constellation boundary.  This is a
bit wasteful, as many values are only ever used for one boundary, but
makes the search easy: do a binary search for right ascension, then for
declination, then look up the indexes in the grid.  Memory requirement:

  1.8k  right ascension table
  1.6k  declination table
 46.6k  grid table
    1k  constellation name abbreviations
